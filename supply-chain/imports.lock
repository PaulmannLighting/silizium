* `src/lib.rs` contains `#![cfg_attr(not(test), forbid(unsafe_code))]`
* There are 2 cases of `unsafe` in `src/external.rs` but they seem to be
  correct in a straightforward way - they just propagate the marker trait's
  impl (e.g. `impl bytemuck::Pod`) from the inner to the outer type

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
